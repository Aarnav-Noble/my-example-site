            <h3>Daniel Cormier</h3>
            <p>Incredible wrestler with a surprisingly good stand-up for someone as short as him. He is also a very likeable person, especially 
                during his weekly podcasts with Ariel Helwani and commentary. He is definately one of the best wrestlers in the UFC and the 
                best heavyweight when he was in his prime.  
            </p>

          <div class="featured-item">
            <h3>Max Holloway</h3>
            <p>He is by far the best boxer in the UFC with his constant pressure and unimaginable stamina. He is a very experienced fighter for
                someone who has not even reached his thirties yet. His improvements in each fight shows that he has not reached his prime yet which
                is shocking considering his achievements so far. Definately the best featherweight in all of UFC and a very likeable person.
            </p>

          <div class="featured-item">
            <h3>Khabib Nurmagomedov</h3>
            <p>29-0. That's all you have to say for the Dagestani wrestler. No one has found any flaws on him and many people think he has
                not reached his prime yet, making his sudden retirement so sudden. He is easily the P4P in my opinion and with no one coming close
                as of now. His religious beliefs and discipline makes him an amazing role model for any one. Undefeated.
            </p>

          <div class="featured-item">
            <h3>Israel Adesanya </h3>
            <p>The last stylebender is undefeated in the UFC and has over 100 kickboxing fights. This is shown in the fights as his incredible
              stand-up almost always knocks his opponents out or dominates them. His ground-game and takedown defence is getting better and better 
              each fight which could easily make him a future P4P #1.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="featured-item">
            <h3>Darren Till</h3>
            <p>Probably the most controversial fighter from the bunch, he is one of the more underrated middleweight fighters in the middleweight
              division. His powerful left hand, increasingly good takedown defence and other assets makes him a fighter to look out for. He has had 
              few setbacks but this is a new weight class and he has done well so far.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="featured-item">
            <h3>Rose Namajunas</h3>
            <p> One of the only female fighters I respect, Rose has an outstanding stand-up and an underrated submittion game. This along with her 
              mentality and midset, before and during the fight, makes her a very smart fighter. Her along with many other female fighters in the 
              strawweight division easily makes this best women's weightclass by far.
